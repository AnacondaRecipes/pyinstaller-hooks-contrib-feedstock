  description: |
    A "hook" file extends PyInstaller to adapt it to the special needs and
    methods used by a Python package. The word "hook" is used for two kinds of
    files. A runtime hook helps the bootloader to launch an app, setting up the
    environment. A package hook (there are several types of those) tells
    PyInstaller what to include in the final app - such as the data files and
    (hidden) imports mentioned above.
